As a user I want to be able to see the effort and knowledge within the application.
 
## Challenges

I had a very hard time with my css. but made it work. Spent so much time on it, I have a new appreciation for random webites and their developers. Another challenge I had was the my work section. I only have one past assignment and a mini project I was working on but has been on the back burner. Updated the mini project because it wasnt my best work being it was a back burner project.

### Achievements 

Getting the nav bar to the top right! Again the css was the biggest challenge but overcoming it was a great achievement. I enjoyed this assignment and the fact that I will be able to continue to update it as I grow. Even excited to see my future achievments and the trail of progression and knowledge.
